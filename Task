1. Write a program to remove an element from a linked list; the remove function should take just
the element to be removed. Is this function easy to writeâ€”and will it be fast? Could this be
made easier or faster by adding an additional pointer to the list?

2. Write a program that adds elements to a linked list in sorted order, rather than at the beginning.

3. Write a program to find an element in a linked list by name.
